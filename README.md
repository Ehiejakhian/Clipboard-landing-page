## MEET ME
Good day. I'm Ehi. I'm an aspiring developer from Edo, Nigeria. I took this challenge - as any other person would, to develop my CSS skills. Here's how I did it and thanks for reading!

My humble solution:

## My process
After my HTML, I start styling with padding. I set the margin of all elements to zero and then give all elements borders. This helps me visualize all element boundaries - all this I do without adding any color.

Then, I add color, backgrounds and border radii to the assigned elements. I prefer using Comic Sans MS as my font because it feels relaxing to my eyes and it helps me think better. I can't explain it though, it's just a feeling.

Funny and weird, right?üòÅ

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned
I#ve learned a great deal of how to create responsive padding with percentages. Percentages help simplify responsiveness using their full values as comparisons for size.

```css
footer {
    width: 100%;
    background: #f1f1f1;
    display: flex;
    gap: 30px;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
    padding: 70px 10%;
}
```

### Continued development

In this challenge, I had many problems with the footer. I just can position them correctly with grid or flex and as you may have seen, I left it that way. I would love to have help on that.

Also, I will need all the help I can get on using flex wraps.

## Author
For now I don't have a website of my own, but I am working on having one soon. I'll also need all the help I can get on this one. It's very important.
